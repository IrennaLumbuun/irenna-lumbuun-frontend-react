Build with ReactJS.

## Notes
Back in December 2020, I decided that I wanted to learn Angular. So, I built a personal website ([see github repo](https://github.com/IrennaLumbuun/irenna-lumbuun-frontend)). While the project helped me get familiar with how modules and services are set up in Angular, I did not get as comfortable working with Angular as I do with React. I also was not able to put more time into learning Angular because I got busy with senior projects, external organizations, and other club activities.

Over the next couple of weeks, I plan to continue working on this website. Converting the source code to React is a more time-efficient decision. While learning Angular is great, I know I won't be able to get as much things done with the time that I have.
